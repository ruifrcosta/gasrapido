# Reservation Module Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the GasRápido reservation module to fully implement the specification requirements.

## Overview

The reservation module has been enhanced to provide a complete implementation of the reservation system that allows clients to reserve gas cylinders with delivery or pickup options, with advance payment or proof of payment, ensuring confirmation, validation, and clarity for all involved profiles.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. State Machine Implementation
- Updated the reservation status enum to include all required states:
  - `pending_reservation`
  - `payment_pending`
  - `proof_uploaded`
  - `confirmed`
  - `cancelled`
  - `expired`
  - `rejected`
- Modified database schema to support the complete state machine
- Updated service layer to handle all state transitions properly

### 2. UI Component Enhancements
- Enhanced [ReservationUpload](file:///C:/Users/rui.rodrigues/Desktop/GasRapido/packages/ui/src/components/common/index.ts#L14-L14) component with:
  - Interactive payment method selection
  - Proper state management
  - File upload handling
  - Form validation
  - Added "Comprovativo Upload" payment method
- Enhanced [ReservationVerification](file:///C:/Users/rui.rodrigues/Desktop/GasRapido/packages/ui/src/components/common/index.ts#L15-L15) component with:
  - Proper typing for reservation data
  - Status badge visualization
  - Improved rejection handling
  - Better user feedback

### 3. Business Rule Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive business rules in the service layer:
  - **Cancellation Policy**: Validates cancellation requests based on time constraints
  - **Late Pickup Handling**: Automatically expires pickup reservations that aren't collected within grace period
  - **Stock Management**: Allocates and releases stock based on reservation status
  - **Reservation Expiry**: Processes overdue reservations for both payment timeouts and pickup deadlines

### 4. Service Layer Enhancements
Added new methods to the [ReservationService](file:///C:/Users/rui.rodrigues/Desktop/GasRapido/packages/shared/src/services/reservationService.ts#L26-L696):
- `cancelReservationWithPolicy`: Cancels reservations with business rule validation
- `canCancelReservation`: Checks if a reservation can be cancelled based on business rules
- `expireReservation`: Expires a reservation that has passed its scheduled time
- `isPickupOverdue`: Checks if a reservation is overdue for pickup
- `handleOverduePickup`: Handles overdue pickup by expiring the reservation
- `allocateStock`: Allocates stock for confirmed reservations
- `releaseStock`: Releases stock for cancelled or expired reservations
- `processOverdueReservations`: Automatically processes overdue reservations
- `isReservationExpired`: Checks if a reservation has expired based on business rules

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- Updated reservation_status enum to include all required states
- Enhanced RLS policies to support new states and transitions
- Added proper indexing for performance optimization

## Implementation Details

### State Transitions
The implementation now fully supports all required state transitions:
- `pending_reservation` → `payment_pending`: Client chooses payment method or proof
- `payment_pending` → `confirmed`: Payment detected or proof validated
- `payment_pending` → `proof_uploaded`: Client submits proof
- `proof_uploaded` → `confirmed`: Admin/finance verifies and accepts
- `any` → `cancelled`: Client cancels before confirmation or time limit exceeded
- `pending_reservation` → `expired`: Time for payment or pickup expired
- `proof_uploaded` → `rejected`: Proof invalid or incomplete

### Business Rules Enforcement
- **Reservation Expiry Time**: Maximum time for payment or proof submission after reservation (30-60 minutes for delivery; several hours for pickup)
- **Cancellation Policy**: Client can cancel up to a certain advance time with possible non-refundable fee
- **Late Pickup**: Reservations expire if not picked up within window
- **Stock Allocation**: Stock is reserved at supplier when reservation is confirmed

### Timeout Processing
- Automatic identification of overdue reservations
- Configurable timeout thresholds
- Automatic processing of expired reservations
- Grace periods for pickup reservations

## Components and Features

### Client UI Flow
Enhanced with:
- Interactive payment method selection
- Real-time validation
- Proper error handling
- Status visualization

### Finance/Admin UI Flow
Enhanced with:
- Proper typing for reservation data
- Status badge visualization
- Better rejection handling
- Enhanced verification workflow

### Security and Compliance
- File integrity verification with SHA-256 hashing
- Secure storage with access controls
- Audit logging for all reservation activities
- Authentication requirements for all operations

### Metrics and Analytics
- Reservation rate tracking
- Reservation to payment time monitoring
- No-show rate measurement
- Cancellation rate tracking
