## Active Decisions
- Continue with the monorepo architecture using Turborepo
- Maintain the Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- Focus on completing the advanced AI features before moving to administrative tools
- Prioritize customer-facing features that improve transparency and communication

## Considerations
- Need to ensure all new features maintain the security and compliance standards already established
- Integration with existing systems (authentication, notifications, etc.) should be seamless
- Documentation should be updated as new features are implemented
- Testing should be comprehensive, especially for the AI-powered features
