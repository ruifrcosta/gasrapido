# Active Context - GasRÃ¡pido

## Current Focus
Based on the tasks.md file, the current development focus is on:
1. Completing the Intelligence Engine implementation
2. Finishing work on the alert and notification system
3. Implementing administrative controls
4. Adding price transparency features

## Recent Changes
- Intelligence Engine service has been implemented
- AI agents system is integrated
- Dynamic pricing engine is functional
- Matching and routing system with fallback mechanisms is in place
- Most core infrastructure tasks are completed
- Alert service has been developed
- Notification components have been created
- Alert management screen has been implemented
- Logo assets have been created according to specification
- Asset documentation and organization completed
- Additional UI components created (Dropdown, Toggle, Checkbox, Modal, Toast)

## Next Steps
According to the task list, the immediate priorities are:
1. Integrate alert system with existing notification system
2. Generate PNG and WebP fallbacks for logos
3. Create favicon and app launcher icons
4. Implement administrative override controls and policies
5. Develop price transparency components for customer communication
6. Begin testing and simulation systems for the pricing engine

## Active Decisions
- Continue with the monorepo architecture using Turborepo
- Maintain the Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- Focus on completing the advanced AI features before moving to administrative tools
- Prioritize customer-facing features that improve transparency and communication
- Ensure all assets follow the defined specification for consistency
- Maintain UI components that adhere to the design system principles

## Considerations
- Need to ensure all new features maintain the security and compliance standards already established
- Integration with existing systems (authentication, notifications, etc.) should be seamless
- Documentation should be updated as new features are implemented
- Testing should be comprehensive, especially for the AI-powered features
- Asset optimization and performance should be maintained across all formats
- UI components should follow accessibility guidelines and responsive design principles
