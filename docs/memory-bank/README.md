# Memory Bank - GasRápido

## Purpose
The Memory Bank is a structured knowledge base for the GasRápido project that follows Rui's Anti-Hallucination Framework. It ensures all project understanding is grounded in documented facts rather than assumptions.

## Structure
The Memory Bank consists of core files that build upon each other:

1. **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)** - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
2. **[productContext.md](./productContext.md)** - Problem statement, solution overview, and user personas
3. **[systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)** - Architecture and technical patterns
4. **[techContext.md](./techContext.md)** - Technology stack and development environment
5. **[activeContext.md](./activeContext.md)** - Current focus, recent changes, and next steps
6. **[progress.md](./progress.md)** - Completed work, in-progress items, and future priorities

## Usage
The Memory Bank should be reviewed regularly to:
- Understand the current state of the project
- Identify priorities and next steps
- Maintain consistency in development approach
- Avoid hallucinations or incorrect assumptions

## Maintenance
When working on the project, update the Memory Bank with verified information:
- Document new patterns or decisions
- Update progress tracking
- Clarify context changes
- Add evidence-based insights
