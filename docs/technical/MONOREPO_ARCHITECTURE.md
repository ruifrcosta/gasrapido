# GasRápido Monorepo Architecture

## Overview

The GasRápido project follows a monorepo architecture designed to efficiently manage multiple related applications and shared libraries. This structure promotes code reuse, simplifies dependency management, and streamlines development workflows.

  - Unified data access layer
  - Federation of multiple data sources
  - Flexible querying capabilities

## Shared Packages (packages/)

### Shared Library (packages/shared/)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Common utilities and helper functions
  - Business logic shared across applications
  - Service implementations (authentication, orders, users, etc.)
  - TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Structure**:
  - `services/`: Business logic implementations
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `src/`: Additional shared utilities

### UI Components (packages/ui/)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Reusable UI components
  - Consistent design system across platforms
  - Accessible and responsive components
- **Components**:
  - Buttons, inputs, forms
  - Layout components (cards, modals, navigation)
  - Data display components (tables, lists, charts)
  - Feedback components (alerts, loading indicators)

## Proposed Enhanced Structure

To further improve the monorepo architecture, the following structure is proposed:

```
gasrapido/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/          # React Native mobile application
│   ├── web/             # Next.js web application
│   └── graphql-gateway/ # GraphQL Federation gateway
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/          # Shared libraries and utilities
│   └── ui/              # Shared UI components
├── configs/             # Shared configuration files
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts
├── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as code
├── docs/                # Documentation files
├── k8s/                 # Kubernetes deployment files
├── helm/                # Helm charts
├── nginx/               # NGINX configuration
├── consul/              # Consul configuration
├── monitoring/          # Monitoring configuration
└── supabase/            # Supabase configuration
```

### Configurations (configs/)
- Shared ESLint configuration
- Shared Prettier configuration
- Shared Jest configuration
- Shared Storybook configuration
- Base TypeScript configuration

### Scripts (scripts/)
- Utility scripts for development
- Build scripts for all packages
- Test scripts for all packages
- Linting scripts for all packages
- Deployment scripts
- Code generation scripts

### Infrastructure (infrastructure/)
- Supabase project configurations
- Storage bucket definitions
- Security policies
- Edge functions
- CI/CD pipeline definitions
- Monitoring and alerting configurations

## Environment Management

### Environment Variables
The monorepo follows a structured approach to environment management:

- **Root Level**: Common variables (Supabase URL, region, public keys)
- **App Level**: Application-specific variables
  - `apps/web/.env.local`: Web application variables
  - `apps/mobile/.env`: Mobile application variables
  - `apps/graphql-gateway/.env`: Gateway variables

### Secrets Management
- Use of secure vault services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Supabase Secrets for sensitive data
- Regular rotation of secrets
- Never commit secrets to the repository

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Principles
- Automated build, test, and lint for every commit
- Automatic deployment to development and staging environments
- Manual or approved deployment to production
- Safe rollback procedures
- Clear versioning

### Pipeline Definitions
- **Web Application**: Static deployment (Vercel, Netlify, or Supabase hosting)
- **Mobile Application**: Builds for Android and iOS; beta versions for testers
- **Backend/API**: Serverless deployment or managed services; database migrations
- **GraphQL Gateway**: Deployment of federation gateway

## Shared Logic and Boundaries

### Rules
- Apps can only depend on allowed packages (shared-ui, shared-utils, shared-types)
- No shared package can depend on apps
- Lint rules to prevent forbidden imports between apps and packages
- Versioning control for shared packages

### Versioning Strategy
- Semantic versioning for shared libraries
- Proper versioning for breaking changes or new features
- Clear upgrade paths for dependent packages

## Mobile-Ready Considerations

### Preparations
- Ready for Android and iOS builds with CI
- Shared components between web and mobile via shared-ui
- Mobile device testing and simulations
- Integration of mobile-specific features (camera, geolocation, push notifications)
- Mobile performance optimizations (lazy loading, bundling, app size, image optimization)

## Monitoring and Logging

### Shared Components
- Centralized backend logs
- Frontend error capture (e.g., Sentry)
- Key metrics (latency, errors, requests/sec, payment proof upload failures)
- Visual dashboards

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Code Reuse**: Shared libraries reduce duplication
2. **Consistent Development**: Unified tooling and configurations
3. **Simplified Dependency Management**: Single dependency tree
4. **Atomic Changes**: Cross-cutting changes in a single commit
5. **Improved Collaboration**: Teams can work on different parts simultaneously
6. **Streamlined Testing**: Centralized test infrastructure
7. **Consistent Release Process**: Unified deployment pipeline

## Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Build Times**: Use of Turborepo for caching and parallel execution
2. **Testing Complexity**: Modular testing approach with clear boundaries
3. **Version Conflicts**: Strict versioning and dependency management
4. **Team Coordination**: Clear ownership and communication protocols# GasRápido Monorepo Architecture
