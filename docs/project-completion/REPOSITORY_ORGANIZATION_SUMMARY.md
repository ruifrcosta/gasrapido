# Repository Organization Summary

This document summarizes the work done to organize the GasRápido repository by removing duplicate documents and moving files to appropriate locations within the docs directory.

## Files Removed (Identical Duplicates)

The following files were removed from the root directory because they were identical to files already existing in the docs directory:

1. COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION.md
2. FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
3. FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md
4. IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
5. LOAD_BALANCING.md
6. NEXT_STEPS.md
7. PAYMENT_PROOF_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
8. PROJECT_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION.md
9. PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
10. PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
11. SERVICE_DISCOVERY.md
12. completion_summary.txt

## Files Moved with Different Names

The following files had different content from their counterparts in the docs directory, so they were moved with different names to preserve both versions:

1. PROJECT_COMPLETION.md → docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_ROOT.md
2. README.md → docs/README_ROOT.md
3. tasks.md → docs/tasks_ROOT.md
4. SESSION_SUMMARY.md → docs/memory-bank/SESSION_SUMMARY_ROOT.md
5. PROJECT_COMPLETED.txt → docs/PROJECT_COMPLETED_ROOT.txt

## Current State

The repository is now organized with all documentation files properly located within the docs directory. The root directory contains only essential project files such as:

- Configuration files (.env.example, .eslintrc.js, .gitignore, .prettierrc)
- Project definition files (package.json, tsconfig.json, turbo.json)
- Docker files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- Application directories (apps/, packages/, assets/, scripts/, etc.)
- Infrastructure directories (supabase/, k8s/, helm/, nginx/, consul/, monitoring/, graphql/)

This organization ensures that all documentation is centralized in the docs directory while keeping the root directory clean and focused on essential project files.
